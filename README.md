This is an application for viewing the current weather in your city. Just scan the name of your city through the QR code and the application will tell you the weather. 
I plan to add functionality to search for a city, so that it will be possible to find out the weather forecast without a QR code.
Below I provide several QR codes for testing the application.
Use it and enjoy!
